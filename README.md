## 🏴‍☠️ Who Am I?

👋 Hey there! I'm **Vincent**, a **42 student** passionate about **System Administration, Cybersecurity, and Development**.

💻 Since I got my first computer at 10 years old, I've been fascinated by the world of computing. Debugging and solving complex problems is something I can spend hours on, driven by my curiosity and determination.  
🎮 My interests span **video games, artificial intelligence, app & web development**, and I’m always seeking to refine my skills to find my true specialty.  
🚀 In the future, I aspire to **join a company that shares my values**, where I can **grow, contribute, and innovate**.  

✨ Thanks to **Xavier Niel's initiative**, I have the **opportunity to train at 42**, and I hope to one day contribute to one of his companies.  
🏡 To stay productive, I carefully separate my workspaces, balancing **focused work, sports, and personal hobbies** like **music, writing, video creation, and gaming**.
