## 🏴‍☠️ Who Am I?

👋 Hey there! I'm **Vincent**, a **42 student** passionate about **System Administration, Cybersecurity, and Development**.

💻 Since I got my first computer at 10 years old, I've been fascinated by the world of computing. Debugging and solving complex problems is something I can spend hours on, driven by my curiosity and determination.
🎮 My interests span **video games, artificial intelligence, app & web development**, and I’m always seeking to refine my skills to find my true specialty.
🚀 In the future, I aspire to **join a company that shares my values**, where I can **grow, contribute, and innovate**.

✨ Thanks to **Xavier Niel's initiative**, I have the **opportunity to train at 42**, and I hope to one day contribute to one of his companies.
🏡 To stay productive, I carefully separate my workspaces, balancing **focused work, sports, and personal hobbies** like **music, writing, video creation, and gaming**.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Team -  [![Logo eve](https://github.com/eve-enterprise/eve-enterprise/blob/main/logo_eve.svg)](https://github.com/eve-enterprise)

🎮 EVE is a development team composed of Vincent & Even, born at 42 Perpignan, a school where peer-to-peer learning shapes autonomous and creative developers.

🚀 From our first steps on CryptX to the initial version of Snake, we structured our collaboration under the EVE (Even & Vincent) banner. More than just a duo of developers, we have made EVE a laboratory of ideas, a space for experimentation where we explore, learn, and create without limits.
